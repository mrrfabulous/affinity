            General
            <p>
              Although the Company will always endeavour to meet all delivery or
              collection agreements no liability will be accepted by the Company
              for a claim of compensation should the agreed date be extended
              from the original agreement made. No lability is accepted by the
              Company in respect of the Good's supplied by the Company in
              accordance with the Customer's own specification and/or
              measurements. Nothing contained within these Terms and Conditions
              of Sale does, nor will affect your statutory rights. All out pie
              carpets, whatever their quality, method of construction or pile
              content, may show a shading effect when in use (and in some cases
              even without wear) though when and where it will occur cannot be
              predicted Variously referred to as Water Marking, Pooling,
              Tracking or Ple Pressure shading is characteristic of all textile
              materials with a pile or nap, but the effect is especially
              noticeable on plain velvet carpets or carpets with a high
              proportion of oper ground in the pattem. Areas of shading are
              inegular in shape and size and have a darker appearance then the
              surrounding carpets when seen from one angle of the pile, which
              may be permanent. The shading effect, which may be accentuated by
              room lighting or certain areas of frequent use, does not affect
              the quality of wearife of the carpet and is not a fault in
              manufacture.. When carpets are selected from samples it is
              occasionally found that variations occur in colour to the actual
              carpet supplied. Every effort will, of course, be made to ensure
              as exact a match as possible. but no guarantee of matching can be
              given. The sizes as quoted for the width of carpet are
              approximate. This can vary due to several factors and the
              tolerance conforms with Brash Standards Institute No. 3855
              allowing for a variation of +1.25% In the case of partial
              completion of an order, which may occur for a variety of reasons,
              the Company shall stil be entitled to payment proportional to the
              amount of goods supplied

            Cleaning
            <p>
              The Company recommends that carpets should be cleaned by
              professionals. A dry-cleaning method only should be used when
              cleaning woven carpets such as Wiltons and Axminsters as any other
              method of cleaning may result in the carpet shrinking or
              distorting.
